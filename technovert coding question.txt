System Test
1.  Coffee Machine Simulator
Create a REPL (Read, Eval, Print, Loop) console app in any language of your choice which can be used to manage a “Coffee Machine Simulator” with following features.
Our Coffee machine will contain the ingredients to make coffee i.e., milk, water, and coffee beans. Let’s say our coffee machine can hold infinite amounts of all the ingredients but initially contains nothing. 
Our Coffee machine will also contain a money box which will store all the money it collects through selling but initially it is empty.
There would be different types of coffee’s that can be selected which will have separate prices and amounts of ingredients required. The types of coffee are:
a.  Espresso
•   price - $4/cup
•   water needed – 250 ml/cup
•   milk needed – 0 ml/cup
•   beans needed - 16/cup
b.  Latte
•   price - $7/cup
•   water needed – 350 ml/cup
•   milk needed – 75 ml/cup
•   beans needed - 20/cup
c.  Cappuccino
•   price - $6/cup
•   water needed – 200 ml/cup
•   milk needed – 100 ml/cup
•   beans needed - 12/cup

1.  There should be a “buy” option which enables the user to buy a coffee of their choice. The coffee would be dispensed only if the machine contains enough ingredients to make that coffee otherwise it will show aerror message. After coffee is dispensed, money in our box will be updated as well as remaining ingredients amounts.
2.  There should be a “fill” option which lets us add the ingredients as user specifies.
3.  There should be a “take” option which enables the maintainer to take the money in the money box.
4.  There should be a “show” option which enables the user to check the ingredients left in the coffee machine.
5.  There should be an “exit” option which stops the simulation.

Extension:
There should be an option “analytics” which will display count of all the coffees it sold, amount it earned, ingredients it consumed.
